- <b>Algebraic Geometry</b> is <font color="#ff0099"><b>surface by equation</b></font><br>
<br>
In details,I major in pure mathematics ,in details Algebraic Geometry. My research object is  mathematical surface by Algebraic equation.  I  am inclined on  "algebraic" equation ,not differential equation. Before introducing the direct context, please consider nonlinear one equation or ,if you can, equations(simultaneous equations).  Usually equation(s) have ,so it called,singular points.
In lower than four dimention, we take one equation and its figure with two valuables x, y. Such as y=x , y=x^2,we already got classical equations ,LHD(left hand side) of the equation is one-degree ,and RHD(the other side) is n-degree.Such as y^2=x^2,we also did,LHD two-degree,and RHD two-degree. If one equation is more  complex ,we will treat it with more difficulty. 
As the first of my research, pick up some equation:LHD is two-degree y and RHD is three-degree x. This equation has various and interesting property. For simple explanation,we name this eq elliptic curves. (In truth, the definition is wrong.) It is cruel that we see a general surface immediately. So we see a set which has continuously variable elliptic curves(fibres) and finitely many singular curves(fibres). This set is named elliptic surface.

On this abstract ,Fibration is defined with (to say easily) the translation(morphism) of algebraic surface with proper plane.   Any fibre is a line or a curve. Finitely  many fibres are singular. A singular fibre  has the interesting property. So called desingularization act fibres then singular fibres are split to  irreducible lines or other curves ,and also  it has singular points. Classifying surface is my research focus. "Classifying" has,in general, so many meanings.  I aim at the singularity on surface.Blowing up is operation element to desingularization and is giving a new line and then is translating the original fibre to one-stroke-drawing fibre.  These indeed focus on singularity,not focusing on non-singularity part or differentially researching . After all,classifying  is determined with fibre type. Fibre type is ,for instance,  by intersection number. Intersection number is connected with lattice theory and bilinear form,divisor(important mathematical tool).Roughly definined,divisor is a formative summation of  local polynomial. These notations let me achieve classifying any algebraic surfaces with calculation ,although in lower than four dimention.

My experience of resolving equations may serves making the strategy in a coorporation work. I  always revolve  hypothesis and trying. I associated my knowledge and applied over my life. For consulting ,IT,adviserly ,cyber security, I will  work and contribute socirty and do my social mission .<br><br>
